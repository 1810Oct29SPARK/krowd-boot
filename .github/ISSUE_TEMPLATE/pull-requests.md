If you are a team member only make pull requests to the captain branch or any other necessary branch. When you are making a comment in git pull make sure that it is quick and concise and that it has to do with the pull request. If you are the captain you can make pull request to the dev branch. When you do please notify the DevOps team for approval on the pull afterward the bug and DevOps team will review your pull and confirm your pull request. Unless you are a member of the DevOps team you should not be making any pull requests to the DevOps team. Two reviews must be made on the pull request, one by another member of the DevOps team and another from Emily specifically.

Warning: Git hub does not allow us to have these people enforce the pull requests easily. Anyone can approve a pull request but that doesn't mean you should. Removing a pull request can only be handled by the members of the DevOps Team and Emily.
